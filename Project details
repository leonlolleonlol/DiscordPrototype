You are implementing a versatile communication platform for seamless interaction through text channels and direct messaging (e.g., similar to Discord or Slack). Whether youâ€™re collaborating with a team, connecting with a community, or chatting privately with friends, the platform offers an intuitive and organized space to stay connected. Users can create topic-specific channels, share media, and engage in one-on-one conversations, all while enjoying customizable features that enhance the experience. With a clean interface and robust privacy options, the platform is the perfect hub for meaningful and efficient communication.
 
You need to implement the following three core features (need to be broken down into user stories):
 
Text Channels for Group Communication
Users can join a set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social").
Messages sent in a channel are visible to all users in that channel.
Direct Messaging Between Users  
Users can join a predefined set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social").
Role-Based User Permissions
Two roles: Admin and Member.
Admins can create/delete channels and moderate messages (delete inappropriate ones).
Members can only send and view messages.
In addition to these three core features, you need to propose one feature with your TA. You are free to use any programming language or framework for the project.
